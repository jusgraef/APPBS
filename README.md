## Don't get confused: The importance of filtering for canonical protein isoforms during integrative analysis of phosphoproteomics data


This is my final project in the Applied Python Programming for Biomedical Sciences course () 2021/22 at Copenhagen University.

The main purpose of the code is to assign the canonical isoforms and the corresponding amino acid position of a modification to each protein in a phosphoproteomics dataset. Using this approach, the overlap of phosphosites from the primary data to secondary data from publications and databases can be improved if no sequence information is given in the secondary data.
